# Information-Visualisation
This is an Information Visualisation project in Python that explores the data visually.
The dataset is about ChrisCo - a fictional, but nonetheless very successful, company managing a range of venues across the UK. ChrisCo collects a huge amount of data about individual customers visiting its venues using its loyalty card scheme but this customer data has been aggregated/averaged to give information about the companyâ€™s 40 venues, each identified by a unique 3 letter code (e.g. ABC, XYZ, etc).
The data is compiled into two dataframes: one containing daily visitor data (one row for each date); the other containing summary data (one row for each venue), compiled from all of the .csv files, including the daily visitors.
